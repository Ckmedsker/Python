Cam's Song Creator User Manual

If the user chooses to exit at any given point, there is an "Exit" button in the top left of both pages.


If the listbox below the text at the top is empty, the only options the user has is to exit or create a new song!
To create a new song, the user must click the "Create Song!" button in the bottom right.
Once clicked, the user is greeted with a new page.
Here the user can play around with the notes by manually clicking the buttons with letters on them.
Above are labels notating which notes will be played with the button below.
The user can choose to go back home with nothing being created if they so desire.
The user can also choose to create a song. 
First they must enter a name for their song into the textbox in the bottom middle.
Next they can press the "Start/Stop Recording" button located on the middle left.
When clicked, the recording begins, but it does not begin timing until the first note is played.
Once in this "recording" mode, the program enables all the notes to be played with the corresponding key on the user's keyboard.
If the user would like to pause their recording, they can pause notes being tracked by clicking the "Start/Stop Recording" button again.
This will not stop the timings between key presses, so keep that in mind.
If the user is dissatisfied with their recording mid-recording, they can delete it by clicking the "Delete Current Recording" button.
Once the user is happy with their song, they can click the "Back Home and Save Song" button located in the bottom right.

The user can play a song by clicking on the song in the listbox, and then clicking the "Play Selected Song" button in the bottom middle.
To delete a song, they can do this by clicking on the song in the listbox and then clicking the "Delete Selected Song!" in the bottom left.
